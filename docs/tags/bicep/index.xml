      <description>This is going to be a longer one. You have been warned! This adventure started last week when I attended the Azure User Group Norway with a session on Azure SQL networking secrets by Dennes Torres.
Dennes showed a setting in the firewall rules on Azure SQL server that said, &amp;ldquo;Allow Azure services and resources to access this server&amp;rdquo;. Now you might think &amp;ldquo;Yeah, I need that for my App Service to access the database&amp;rdquo;, but in reality, this setting will allow ALL Azure IPs to access the SQL server!</description>

      <description>Anyone who have used the portal to add rules to Azure Firewall will know how tedious and annoying it can get. With small fields to write both destination and source, it does get old very quick. And something that I found myself doing for several customers was setting the rules required for Azure AD Connect. I quickly got tired of doing it manually, so I created a Bicep template to deploy it much easier and faster.</description>
